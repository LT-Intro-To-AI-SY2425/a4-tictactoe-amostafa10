# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

Making the function to check if a player won.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

Making random valid moves.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

So, naturally, we would still be making random moves. However, with the power of hope and belief, I will assume that it plays the best move everytime.
